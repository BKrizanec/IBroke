This is an initial version of a expense tracking app that serves the purpose of practicing C# knowledge with some fiscal responsibility! The initial version of the app contains the basic functions that you might need in terms of inputting an expense or an income, filtering it by 30 days or all time, and calculating an average per month. There will be further updates along the way.
